# WIP: Answerbook Uploader
The goad of this project is to combine technologies such as: 

 - [Web USB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB)
 - [Android Debugging Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)

Into one single chrome plugin that allows imperial students to upload scanned answers from their phones directly into answerbook. 
Contributions Welcome.
